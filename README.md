Hi, my name is Joshua MacVicar, but most refer to me as Mac. I am an 18 year old FiveM & Web developer. I have over 3 years experience developing for FiveM, and over 2 years experience in web development.

I am proficient in lua, javascript, html and css.
I also have experience in php.

I do my best to make my products and documentation as easy to use/follow as possible, so please read all documentation carefully and apply common sense. I am always happy to help users who HAVE read the documentation and applied common sense via discord Mac#8765.
Please note, that I will NOT offer support to people who have failed to read my documentation, and have failed to apply common sense. Also, please do some of your own research before contacting me as I am a very busy person, and don't have time to explain issues which could have easily been sorted by a simple google search.

I hope you enjoy the resource I make, and I am always looking for feedback, both positive and negative; so long as it is constructive.
